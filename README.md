          * Accounting Information systems (AIS) have become indispensable in the field, and this book provides clear guidance for students or professionals needing to get up to speed. Designed to suit a one-semester AIS course at the graduate, undergraduate, or community college level, Core Concepts of Accounting Information Systems explores AIS use and processes in the context of modern-day accounting. Coverage includes conceptual overviews of data analytics, accounting, and risk management, as well as detailed discussion of business processes, cybercrime, database design and more to provide a well-rounded introduction to AIS.
         
          * Case studies reinforce fundamental concepts using real-world scenarios that encourage critical thinking, while AIS-at-Work examples illustrate complex procedures or concepts in everyday workplace situations. Test Yourself questions allow students to gauge their level of understanding, while End of Chapter questions stimulate application of new skills through problems, cases, and discussion questions that facilitate classroom dialogue. Practical, current, relevant, and grounded in everyday application, this book is an invaluable resource for students of managerial accounting, tax accounting, and compliance.
